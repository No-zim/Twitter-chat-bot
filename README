To run you need python3, but not python 3.7(it is not supported yet) 

In addition, you will need a twitter account (you can use your own or create a new one) I recommend creating a new one

At this point I assume you created a puppet account on twitter and have login and password for that account.
Go to www.developer.twitter.com and Apply using your login and password. Follow the steps of setting up account.
You will need to verify your phone # and email address there, and explain what will you be doing

Now that you've set up you developer account go to top right corner where it says your account name: 
    go to apps
    create app
    fill out 'App name' = somename, 'Website URL'= somename.io 
    fill out 'Application description' = write what you want to use it for
    fill out 'Tell us how this app will be used' = copy paste from Application description
    create
    
You are promted with app details
    go to 'keys and tokens'
          go to 'Access token & access token secret' press 'generate'
          
It creates two sentenses of random letters and numbers, and you are done with this step

Now go the code, without closing your browser window because you will need 
:Consumer API keys
:Access token & access token secret
